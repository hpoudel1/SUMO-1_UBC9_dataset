# SUMO-1_UBC9_dataset
C(t) data of residue water hydrogen bonds for SUMO-1 and UBC9

The residue number, i.e., res#.dat, in each subfolder corresponds to the residue number listed in Table S1 (SUMO-1) and Table S2 (UBC9).

Importantly, C(t) is listed at each time step, where the interval between time steps is 250 fs (0.25 ps). The first entry in each data file is C(0), the second is C(250 fs), the third is C(500 fs), etc.
