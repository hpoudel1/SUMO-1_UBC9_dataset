# SUMO-1_UBC9_dataset
C(t) data of residue water hydrogen bonds for SUMO-1 and UBC9

The residue number, i.e., res#.dat, in each subfolder corresponds to the residue number listed in Table S1 (SUMO-1) and Table S2 (UBC9).

Importantly, C(t) is listed at each time step, where the interval between time steps is 250 fs (0.25 ps). The first time indicated corresponds to t = 0.
